# Stock Market Forecasting using Time Series & Deep Learning

This project involves analyzing and forecasting **Tata Consultancy Services (TCS)** stock prices using classical time series models and deep learning.

The notebook includes:
- Data collection from Yahoo Finance
- Data preprocessing and visualization
- Model building with ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet, and LSTM
- Final comparison of all models with performance metrics

---

## Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python** (Jupyter Notebook)
- **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly** ‚Äì Data handling & visualization
- **Statsmodels** ‚Äì ARIMA & SARIMA models
- **Prophet (by Facebook)** ‚Äì Trend and seasonality forecasting
- **TensorFlow/Keras** ‚Äì Deep learning (LSTM)
- **Scikit-learn** ‚Äì Metrics and data scaling
